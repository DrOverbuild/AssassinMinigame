AssassinMinigame is a plugin that integrates a minigame called Assassin into your survival server.

### How to play Assassin
All of the players playing assassin are teleported to the game coordinator. They are given 30 seconds to spread out. After 30 seconds, one player is chosen to be the Assassin, and he must kill all of the other players in the minigame to win. The assassin must kill secretly, so the other players don't know who is the assassin.

However, one player is chosen to be the archer, and this player must find the assassin and kill him so he and the rest of the players (the civilians) can win. If the assassin kills the archer, another player must retrieve the dropped infinity bow and arrow and then that player becomes the archer.

Every 15 seconds, an item spawns around the players. It is either a bow or an arrow, and the assassin cannot pick up these items; only civilians can, so if the assassin takes too long to kill all the players, the civilians have a chance to kill him if the archer doesn't.

### Getting in the Game
This plugin was built so that Assassin could be played on a single-world survival server. To play the game, players must type "/assassin join". The server will announce that this player is playing Assassin, and "(In Minigame)" will be appended to his username on the tab list. Once there are at least three players playing Assassin, the game coordinator (or an operator) must type "/assassin start" to start the game.

### The Game Coordinator
If there are no players in the minigame, the first one who does becomes the game coordinator. This player has the ability to start the game. The game coordinator will be able to do much more than this in the future, such as kick a player from the minigame, give the game coordinator status to another player, choose the map, etc. However, these features have not been added yet.

### Additional Info
* This plugin creates the team "Assassin" from the server's main scoreboard, plus a new objective called "assassinScore". If you are currently using these on your server, using this plugin is not recommended.
